fd6e798d-54d6-44e0-bc45-f308e9d06776,old | young,"You’re seeing the pattern. Youth is the vibrant, active emergence of potential (IS), while the old represents the crystallized, historical form of IT.","Most players didn’t see it that way. The majority perceives the ""becoming"" of the young as IS and the ""finished"" structure of the old as IT."
32d5b60a-5567-4b3a-a4a0-66c24ad6452d,on | off,"Spot on! ""On"" represents the active, powered flow of energy (IS), while ""off"" represents the inert, disconnected state of IT.","That choice doesn't quite align with the crowd.
